<Name>Tentes</Name>
<RawDialog>You know, {Pause:620}I always see those tents when I come by here, {Pause:1342}but I've never actually learned what they are. {Pause:1309}{Emotion:DeepThought}Maybe they're merchants? {Pause:1105}Seems like they'd be closer to town square, though. {Pause:714}{Emotion:Neutral}Or gypsies? {Pause:1154}I'd have thought they would've left by now if so.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>Tu sais, {Pause:620}Je vois toujours ces tentes quand je passe par ici, {Pause:1342}mais je n'ai jamais su ce qu'elles étaient. {Pause:1309}{Emotion:DeepThought}Peut être qu'il s'agit de marchants ? {Pause:1105}Quoi qu'ils semblent loin du centre. {Pause:714}{Emotion:Neutral}Ou des gitans ? {Pause:1154}J'imagine qu'ils auraient quitté la ville depuis un moment si c'était le cas.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:DeepThought}Or, maybe {Pause:680}{PlaySound:Realization}it's all a big front for a secret group of dragon egg smugglers, {Pause:1225}{Emotion:Neutral}and they're all hoping that, just like I have all this time, {Pause:817}we pay them no mind, because they're just tents of no consequence in the background...</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:DeepThought}Ou peut être {Pause:680}{PlaySound:Realization}qu'il s'agit d'une couverture pour un groupe secret de voleurs d'œufs de drangons, {Pause:1225}{Emotion:Neutral}et ils espèrent tous que, comme moi pendant tout ce temps, {Pause:817}on ne leur prette aucune attention, parce que ce ne sont que quelques tentes sans importance dans le décors ...</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:Surprised}...when all this time, right under our noses, they've been shifting dozens upon dozens of illicit dragon eggs to a shadowy, nefarious crime boss.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:Surprised}... alors que tout ce temps, juste sous notre nez, ils ont convoyés des dizaines et des dizaines d'œufs de dragons illégaux vers un sombre et maléfique parrain du crime.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:Neutral}...Nah, {Pause:546}probably gypsies.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>{Emotion:Neutral}...Nah, {Pause:546}probablement des gitans.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>Twi, {Pause:645}I'm pretty sure those are just set up for the town merchants.</RawDialog>
<RawDialog>Twi, {Pause:645}je suis assez certaine qu'ils sont juste là pour les marchants de la ville.</RawDialog>

<RawDialog>Quoique, {Pause:690}maintenant que je le regarde plus près... {Pause:1391}il y a un ballon. {Pause:1357}Avec... une note? {Pause:782}Hmmm.</RawDialog>
